# Wranglr 

### Bookmarklet that pulls all of the relevant content from a page and creates a word cloud based on usage

# Process

## Prep 

My first step was admittedly looking up what a bookmarklet was and why they are useful. 
I had no idea it was possible to bookmark scripting tasks like this instead of using the more
user-friendly option of extentions. 

Once I figured out what they were I began to lay out a plan for this task: 

- create a repository
- initialize a node environment for gulp 
- set up basic file structure 

> Anchor tags have a pretty low character limit depending on browser so an external script is necessary
